# General
[ ] Detection of Disciplinary lifecycle (birth and death of diciplines according to theory)
[ ] Detection of Paradigme shifts


# Science Space
[ ] Clusterings
[ ] Regional temporal changes in distribution

# Citation tree
[ ] Work out citation weights and contribution vector (and test)
[ ] Look at different author's contribution vectors over time
[ ] temporal analysis of mutation magnitudes / vectors (average and distribution and stuff)
[ ] Temporal analysis of each gene mutation
[ ] Getting a paper, and adding the citation weights of its children, and its children's children multipled by those weights? Idk
[ ] Regression to get the inverse of the decay rate - and use this as the "death" parameter in the Cox Proportional-Hazards Model
[ ] Comparison of path Simularity using sequnece alignment techniques like the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm from Bio-informatics
[ ] Diversity of tree paths - using entropy or Shannon diversity index
[ ] Distribution of mutation magnitudes across different disciplines
[ ] Correlation of mutation vector to some sort of success metric?? (Find what traits have high/low fitnesses
[ ] Classification AI of mutation vector to say if it is a paper that makes a difference or not? Idk
[ ] Look at heredibility of each component (high heredability means value is loyal to parents, if it is low - it means that that value tends to come from the author alone, and not the works it cites)
[ ] Genetic Specisation
[ ] Extinsion events?
